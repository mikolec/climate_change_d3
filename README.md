# Climate Change Burden of Disease Visualization

### d3.js project from Codecademy

In this project, you’ll bind data to div elements and create a simple bar chart to display the climate change burden of disease by World Health Organization region. You will also create a legend list that will highlight the corresponding bar when you hover over the corresponding legend item and vice versa. The data we will visualize is described as follows:

> “As part of a broader project to assess major risk factors to health, the burden of disease resulting from climate change was assessed.Measuring the health effects from climate change can only be very approximate. Nevertheless, a assessment coordinated by WHO, taking into account only a subset of the possible health impacts, concluded that the modest climate change that has occurred since the 1970s was already causing over 140 000 excess deaths annually by the year 2004.”

Find the raw data describing “climate change attributable deaths” and the different regions at the World Health Organization repository.
